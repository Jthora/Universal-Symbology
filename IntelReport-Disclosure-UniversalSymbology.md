# Page 2: Detailed Mathematical Proofs and Examples

**Objective**: Provide rigorous mathematical proofs and detailed examples to satisfy critiques from Mathematics, Physics, and Applied Mathematics professors.

## 1. Detailed Proofs of Geometric Invariants

### 1.1. Circle Invariance Under Rotation

**Proof**:
Given a circle with the equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), we aim to prove its invariance under rotation about its center \((h, k)\).

**Transformation Equations**:
A rotation matrix \( R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \) transforms the coordinates \( (x, y) \) around the origin.

1. Translate the circle to the origin:
   \[
   x' = x - h, \quad y' = y - k
   \]

2. Apply the rotation:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ y'' \end{pmatrix} = R(\theta) \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   This gives:
   \[
   x'' = x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta
   \]
   \[
   y'' = x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta
   \]

3. Substitute back into the circle equation:
   \[
   (x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta)^2 + (x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta)^2 = r^2
   \]

4. Simplify using trigonometric identities:
   \[
   x'^2 (\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + y'^2 (\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) = r^2
   \]
   \[
   x'^2 (1) + y'^2 (1) = r^2
   \]
   \[
   x'^2 + y'^2 = r^2
   \]

5. Translate back:
   \[
   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
   \]

The equation remains unchanged, proving the circle's invariance under rotation.

---

### 1.2. Advanced Harmonic Analysis

**Fourier Analysis of Complex Waveforms**:
Given a complex waveform \( f(x) \), decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components using Fourier series.

**Fourier Series**:
\[
f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
\]

1. Calculate Fourier coefficients \( a_n \) and \( b_n \):
   \[
   a_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
   \]
   \[
   b_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \, dx
   \]

2. Reconstruct the waveform using the calculated coefficients:
   \[
   f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) + b_n \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nx}{L}\right) \right)
   \]

**Proof of Superposition Principle**:
If \( y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \), the resultant wave \( y = y_1 + y_2 \) can be written as:
\[
y = A \sin(kx - \omega t) + A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
\]

Using the trigonometric identity for sum of sine functions:
\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)
\]

This gives:
\[
y = 2A \sin\left(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
\]

The superposition results in a wave with amplitude \( 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \) and phase shift \( \frac{\phi}{2} \).

---

### 1.3. Application of Curvature in Geometry

**Curvature of a Curve**:
The curvature \( \kappa \) of a curve defined parametrically by \( (x(t), y(t)) \) is:
\[
\kappa = \frac{|x'y'' - y'x''|}{\left( (x')^2 + (y')^2 \right)^{3/2}}
\]

**Example**:
Consider a parametric curve defined by \( x(t) = a \cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = b \sin(t) \):

1. First derivatives:
   \[
   x' = -a \sin(t), \quad y' = b \cos(t)
   \]

2. Second derivatives:
   \[
   x'' = -a \cos(t), \quad y'' = -b \sin(t)
   \]

3. Compute the curvature:
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{|-a \sin(t)(-b \sin(t)) - b \cos(t)(-a \cos(t))|}{\left( (-a \sin(t))^2 + (b \cos(t))^2 \right)^{3/2}}
   \]
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{ab (\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t))}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
   \]
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{ab}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
   \]

This calculation demonstrates the curvature of an ellipse at different points.

- **Wave Equation**: \( \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0 \) shows the periodic nature of electromagnetic waves.

**Interference and Diffraction**:
- **Young's Double-Slit Experiment**: Demonstrates wave interference, where the intensity pattern \( I = I_0 \cos^2\left( \frac{\pi d \sin\theta}{\lambda} \right) \) depends on the wave properties.

   - Use a convolutional encoder with generator polynomials \( g_1 = 111 \) and \( g_2 = 101 \).
   - Encode the data stream to produce a wave-like encoded signal. The encoded output sequence might be `111, 101, 110, 011, 101, 111`.

2. **Transmission**:
   - The encoded signal, visualized as a waveform, is transmitted over a noisy channel.
   - Errors are introduced during transmission: `111, 101, 100, 011, 101, 111` (where the error is highlighted).

3. **Error Detection and Correction with the Viterbi Algorithm**:

## 1. Detailed Proofs of Geometric Invariants

### 1.1. Circle Invariance Under Rotation

**Proof**:
Given a circle with the equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), we aim to prove its invariance under rotation about its center \((h, k)\).

**Transformation Equations**:
A rotation matrix \( R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \) transforms the coordinates \( (x, y) \) around the origin.

1. Translate the circle to the origin:
   \[
   x' = x - h, \quad y' = y - k
   \]

2. Apply the rotation:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ y'' \end{pmatrix} = R(\theta) \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   This gives:
   \[
   x'' = x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta
   \]
   \[
   y'' = x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta
   \]

3. Substitute back into the circle equation:
   \[
   (x' \cos\theta - y' \sin\theta)^2 + (x' \sin\theta + y' \cos\theta)^2 = r^2
   \]

4. Simplify using trigonometric identities:
   \[
   x'^2 (\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + y'^2 (\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) = r^2
   \]
   \[
   x'^2 (1) + y'^2 (1) = r^2
   \]
   \[
   x'^2 + y'^2 = r^2
   \]

5. Translate back:
   \[
   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
   \]

The equation remains unchanged, proving the circle's invariance under rotation.

   \]

**Proof of Superposition Principle**:
If \( y_1 = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \) and \( y_2 = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi) \), the resultant wave \( y = y_1 + y_2 \) can be written as:
\[
y = A \sin(kx - \omega t) + A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
\]

Using the trigonometric identity for sum of sine functions:
\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)
\]

This gives:
\[
y = 2A \sin\left(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)
\]

The superposition results in a wave with amplitude \( 2A \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \) and phase shift \( \frac{\phi}{2} \).

### 1.3. Application of Curvature in Geometry

**Curvature of a Curve**:
The curvature \( \kappa \) of a curve defined parametrically by \( (x(t), y(t)) \) is:
\[
\kappa = \frac{|x'y'' - y'x''|}{\left( (x')^2 + (y')^2 \right)^{3/2}}
\]

**Example**:
Consider a parametric curve defined by \( x(t) = a \cos(t) \) and \( y(t) = b \sin(t) \):

1. First derivatives:
   \[
   x' = -a \sin(t), \quad y' = b \cos(t)
   \]

2. Second derivatives:
   \[
   x'' = -a \cos(t), \quad y'' = -b \sin(t)
   \]

3. Compute the curvature:
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{|-a \sin(t)(-b \sin(t)) - b \cos(t)(-a \cos(t))|}{\left( (-a \sin(t))^2 + (b \cos(t))^2 \right)^{3/2}}
   \]
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{ab (\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t))}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
   \]
   \[
   \kappa = \frac{ab}{\left( a^2 \sin^2(t) + b^2 \cos^2(t) \right)^{3/2}}
   \]

This calculation demonstrates the curvature of an ellipse at different points.
